                        Garth Brooks is getting his money back -- and more -- from a hospital in his hometown that a
                        jury decided had fumbled a $500,000 donation from the country music star.

                        At issue: whether the half-million bucks Brooks donated to Integris Canadian Valley Regional
                        Hospital back in 2005 was to have been used for a new women's center in his mom's name, or was
                        given no-strings-attached to be used on whatever the hospital chose. Pretty clear which side
                        was Brooks', and which was the hospital's.

                        On Tuesday night, the jury awarded Brooks $1 million, half of it actual damages and half
                        punitive, according to the Tulsa World, which noted that the award was the legal maximum.

                        Brooks, who had testified during the weeklong trial -- along with meeting fans and signing
                        autographs -- was greeted by about 40 people and his own music playing loudly in the background
                        when the trial wrapped up around 8 p.m., the Tulsa paper said.

                        "One day Mom's name is going to go on the women's center right there where the hospital is,"
                        Brooks said outside the courtroom. "But that hospital won't be owned by Integris when it
                        happens, I can tell you that. That's my dream."

                        The country star reportedly became quite emotional at times testifying about his mom. He also
                        held up his cellphone outside the courthouse so fans could yell, "Hi, Trisha!" to his wife,
                        Trisha Yearwood, when she called him to hear about the verdict.

                        Brooks' lawyer argued that the singer had a verbal agreement with James Moore, the chief
                        executive of the Yukon, Okla., hospital, to put Colleen Brooks' name on a women's center --
                        that after Moore first suggested naming an intensive care unit, an idea Brooks said he rejected
                        as not suitable for his mom's image.

                    <p>The Life of Chris Gaines, is an album by American country music artist Garth Brooks, in which
                        Brooks assumes the fictitious persona of Australian rock artist Chris Gaines. Originally, this
                        album was intended to be the soundtrack for a movie called The Lamb that would star Brooks as a
                        rock star recalling the different periods of his life. This album was purposely released a year
                        in advance from the scheduled film release date to pique interest in Brooks performing rock
                        instead of country. The Lamb, however, was never filmed due to financial and management
                        problems.</p>

                        Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on February 7, 1962, Garth Brooks signed with Capitol Records and
                        released his self-titled first album in 1989, which had mild success. His third studio effort,
                        Ropin’ the Wind, was the first country album to debut at No. 1 on the pop charts. Brooks has
                        made a number of albums since, selling more than 100 million in all. He retired in 2000, but
                        began performing again in 2009.
                        Commercial Success
                        Although sales for the singer's first album, Garth Brooks (1989), were strong, it would have
                        been hard to predict the amazing success of later releases. Brooks's second effort, No Fences
                        (1990), sold more than 700,000 copies in its first 10 days on the market. His third, Ropin' the
                        Wind (1991), racked in a record-breaking 4 million orders before its release, and became the
                        first album by a country singer to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts. His 1998
                        release, Garth Brooks Double Live, sold over 1 million copies in its first week of sales,
                        breaking the previous record. To date, Brooks has sold more than 100 million albums in his
                        career.</p>
