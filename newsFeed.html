                    <p>Only a few hours after going on sale, country music super star Garth Brook's second show at U.S.
                        Bank Stadium has sold out.

                        Tickets for the first concert, scheduled for Saturday, May 4, 2019, went on sale on Friday and
                        sold out in hours. At the request of Governor Mark Dayton, Brooks added a second date on his
                        tour in Minneapolis for Friday, May 3, 2019.

                        Brooks sold more than 100,000 tickets for the upcoming shows at U.S. Bank Stadium. These shows
                        will be his first in the Twin Cities in four and half years. <br>

                    <p>It seems that country music star Garth Brooks has some friends in high places, too.

                        Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton on Friday called on Brooks to add another Minneapolis show to his
                        upcoming stadium tour — and it sounds like Brooks is on board with the idea.

                        Brooks' May 4 show at US Bank Stadium quickly sold out after tickets went on sale Friday,
                        leaving thousands of Minnesota fans without tickets. In a statement issued Friday night,
                        Dayton's office said "over 50,000 fans were in line, on the phone, or online when the last
                        ticket was sold." <br>

                <div class="textWrap">
                    <img src="images/garthBrooksImg2.png" alt="404">
                    <p>As always, Garth Brooks says, the fans are one step ahead of him. In fact, the country icon
                        explained in a recent Variety interview that it was a fan who helped develop an idea that
                        Brooks and his wife, fellow superstar Trisha Yearwood, had for a new collaboration.
                        "These two girls wrote into Trisha [Yearwood] and I and said, 'Hey, look, I know you guys are
                        gonna do a duet record. Would you ever think about doing a duet concert where the whole night
                        is duets?'" Brooks recalls. "I'm looking at her going, 'No, wait a minute, let's combine the
                        two ideas. What if we cut a live duet record in front of a live audience? And that's how we do
                        our duet record?'"
                        Brooks immediately loved the idea, which would give fans an up-close look at how he creates his
                        albums. "All of the sudden you have a live greatest hits duet record and people get to watch
                        how a record is made, so you kind of bring the studio to the stage," he explains. "Section it
                        off like you do in a regular studio, cut things live right there in front of people. I think
                        it's an awesome idea, and I think it's probably something we're gonna do."

                        The timeline for the new project, Brooks adds, will depend on both his and Yearwood's busy
                        touring schedules for 2019. "The stadium tour kicks off net year in March. Miss Yearwood has
                        her own tour going on, so we'll find a window in there," he continues, explaining that despite
                        the fact that there will be performance dates to work out, those schedules aren't quite as
                        rigorous as they have been in the past.

                        "We're not touring as hard as we did the last three years. The last three years it was, like,
                        396 shows on the tour. This one is gonna be really spread out, just individual nights, 10 a
                        year," Brooks says.

                        As for where the live duets album will be recorded, Brooks hints that although nothing is set
                        in stone, he has a special venue in mind. "We're talking about doing it with the Ryman down
                        here in Nashville," he goes on to say. <br>
